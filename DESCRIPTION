Description: Enhanced RTF wrapper written in R for use with existing R tables
    packages such as huxtable or GT. This package fills a gap where tables in
    certain packages can be written out to RTF, but cannot add certain metadata
    or features to the document that are required/expected in a report for a
    regulatory submission, such as multiple levels of titles and footnotes,
    making the document landscape, and controlling properties such as margins.
