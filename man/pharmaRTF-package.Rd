\description{
Enhanced RTF wrapper written in R for use with existing R tables
packages such as huxtable or GT. This package fills a gap where tables in
certain packages can be written out to RTF, but cannot add certain metadata
or features to the document that are required/expected in a report for a
regulatory submission, such as multiple levels of titles and footnotes,
making the document landscape, and controlling properties such as margins.

This package intends to provide a flexible and reliable framework to connect
R to a pharmaceutical reporting workflow.
